== Welcome to Redis 1.2.6 ==

Redis 1.2.6 fixes two critical replication bugs, and a few improvements.

- Fixed Issue 207 (http://code.google.com/p/redis/issues/detail?id=207)
  (broken replication with binary arguments not in the last position with
   the MSET command or any other command issued with new multi-bulk protocol)
- Fixed Issue 174 (http://code.google.com/p/redis/issues/detail?id=174)
  (temp names collisions producing broken slave-side .rdb files)
- Redis-cli backported from Redis master, with interactive mode, line editing via the linenoise library, auth ability, and much more.
- ZRANGEBYSCORE now supports WITHSCORES as well (backported from master)
- A simplified version of redis-stat (from redis tools) added.

== Welcome to Redis 1.2.5 ==

Redis 1.2.5 fixes a replication bug: multiple slaves connecting to the same
master could lead to random crashes or corruptions.

== Welcome to Redis 1.2.4 ==

Redis 1.2.4 is a bugfix release, problems fixed:

- Replication when .rdb file is bigger than 2GB.

== Welcome to Redis 1.2.3 ==

Hello, 1.2.3 is a bugfix release, problems fixed:

- The example init script was broken for a typo. Fixed.
- Support for large files in 32 bit targets, very important when saving very large databases or when using the Append Only File (when Redis was compiled for 64 bit target there was no problem).
- Now 'make 32bit' uses -m32 instead of Apple-specific -arch
- Stack trace fixed for some Linux targets

== Welcome to Redis 1.2.2 ==

Hello, 1.2.2 is a bugfix release, fixing a problem with BGSAVE and BGREWRITEAOF
copy-on-write semantics. This version of Redis will use a lot less CPU and
memory while performing a BGSAVE and BGREWRITEAOF operation. 

It is very important to upgrade ASAP to this version if you are using Redis
with data persistence via snapshotting or append only file.

Another minor change is that the INFO command will now have a new field showing
memory usage in an human readable form. This was backported from Redis unstable
as well.

There are no other changes.

Have a good time with Redis!

== Welcome to Redis 1.2.1 ==

Hello, 1.2.1 is a bugfix release, fixing a problem with RPOPLPUSH that was
expecting a bulk command where an inline command is the perfectly fine (and
the right one! in order to follow the same behaviour of all the other commands
not sending a payload).

There are no other changes.

Happy hacking,

== Welcome to Redis 1.2.0 ==

This is a rebranded 1.1.95-beta, also known as 1.2.0 release candidate 6
because no critical bug was found in the latest weeks.

Redis 1.0 users are urged to upgrade as this release is backward compatibile
with 1.0 (there are a few changes in some commands, but the new behavior is
saner and you should notice it unless you are abusing the API really hard).
